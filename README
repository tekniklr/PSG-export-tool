Will export all of your PSG posts, tags, and comments into the Movable
Type Import / Export format. This will allow you to import this data into
other blogging software, such as Moveable Type or WordPress.

To use, you will need to configure it slightly – either copy the
configuration array (which defines the location of your PSG files) from
PSG’s index.php, or include a file which sets that information (for me,
that was blogadmin.php). You will also need to change the ‘AUTHOR’ field
in the dump_post function to whatever you want these posts to be
attributed to (assuming they are all by the same person, of course).

Known issues:

  * When I imported the file generated here into WordPress all of my
    comments had quotes and doublequotes escaped after import. I fixed
    this by manually replacing those strings in the comments table in
    the WordPress database.
  * Permalinks inside of posts to other posts will not work, natch.
